I have validated all the columns against the criteria in the dataset table:\n\n- week: 6 Integers (in numeric format) from 1 to 6. No cleaning is needed except that we turn it into \"factor\" format.\n- Sales_method: 5 non-unique values without missing values, containing {Email, Call, Email + Call, em + call, email},after turning after substituting \"em + call\" with \"Email + Call\" and \"email\" with \"Email\" the labels willl be 3 unique values, {Email, Call, Email + Call}, just like the descreption.\n- customer_id: 15000 unique characters without missing values, same as the description. its worthy of notice that customers present in 3 sales strategies (in the present dataset) are mutually exclusive and unique.this was investigated by a simple inner join on customer_id in 3 deifferent classes. No cleaning is needed.\n- nb_sold: numeric values from 7.00 to 16.00 without missing values, same as the description. No cleaning is needed except that we turn it into \"integer\" format.\n- revenue: numeric values from 32.54 to 238.32 with 1074 missing values. missing values are only appriximately 7% and they do not seem to be nonrandomly generated through different sales_methods.As observed in the folloing graph, approximately 50 percent of the data contains both sales and missing values in \"Email\" category. though this portion is slightly different in the other two categories it could be neglected. It could also be observed from the graph below that distribtuion of missing and observed variables in realtion to other variables is almost the same. So we omit the missing values.\n\n![image-8](image-8.png)\n![Pair-wise Distribution of missing values](Missng_pair_image.png)\n                                                    \n- years_as_customer: numeric values from 0 to 63 without missing values, same as the description. No cleaning is needed.\n- nb_site_visits: numeric values from 12 to 51 without missing values, same as the description. No cleaning is needed except that we turn it into \"integer\" format.\n- state: 50 unique characters, same as the description. No cleaning is needed.\n\nAfter the data validation, the dataset contains **13926 rows and 8 columns** without missing values.","metadata":{},"id":"bb403c15-c0ec-4214-9aaa-ed01007f1881","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Customers Specs in Different Groups\nFollowing Scatterplot shows that the largest number of customers and number of sales belong to \"Email\" method. whith respect to sales and customer engagement, \"Call\" and their combination are second and third, respectively.\nCustomers that present in different groups share almost the same length of history in the firm. The Boxplot shows that they almost have the same mean and around 75% of them have been in the system less than 7 years. it is also obvious that customers in \"Email\" group have less history with the system, having a median which is less than that of customers in \"Call\" group.\n![image-7](image-7.png)\n\nIn the following graphs, We can also take a look at the distribution of the customers in total. it is obvious that the majority of the engagement belong to customers with less than 10 years history with the firm. On top of that customers with more than 30 years history have negligible engagement. If we look closer we can observe that customers with less history with the firm have visited our website more, have bought more, and have generated more revenue. \n![image-5](image-5.png)\n\nNext we investigate customers and revenue generated in each state, broken down by sales mehtods. It is almost obvious that in every state Email has the largest share of customers and revenue. Moreover, Texas and California are the states with largest customers and revenue generated in the \"Email + Call\" group.\n\n![image-9](image-9.png)\n\n**Something to consider :** I am not sure whether the number of customers in each cohort has been equal and methods have resulted in different number of sales across these cohorts or population size of each cohort has been chosen unequally. this is something that should be known and I will refer to it later.\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0734348d-b30d-4933-86d2-25ab9c59f038"},{"source":"## Lets Have a Look at revenue and Sales\nnumber of sales, revenue, and number of site visits are positively correlated. this was validated through kendall's correlation test (since these populations do not come from a normal distribtuion). we can see from the density plot that \"Email + Call\" is more likely to generate more visits than the other methods. Moreover, Average price is non-decreasing in number of sold commdities. On top of that, Average number of sold items is increaing in number of visits. So, the method which generates more number of visits, considering the assumption of having equal size of test population in each cohort, is a better choice if generated profit of it, outperforms the cost we incur. \n\n![image-12](image-12.png)\n\n### **Lets look at some useful metrics**\n- **Visit/Customer** is the total number of visits from our site over total number of customers in each method.\n- **Sold/Visit** is the total number of sold items over the total number of visits from website we have gained.\n- **Revenue/Sold** is the average revenue per the number of items we have sold.\n- **Revenue/Customer** is the average revenue we have gained from each customer.\n\nThese metrics are calculated for the first 6 weeks in the table below. It is observable that \"Email + Call\" has the best gain considering these metrics. the problem with it is that the method is time consuming (not as time consuming as \"Call\" method). Considering the fact that call center agent is paid 18.5 $/Hr; in canada for example, [Check Indeed Please](https://ca.indeed.com/career/call-center-representative), and regarding the fact that we have spent 10 minutes in each consumer we can certainly conclude that the revenue gained per customer, 183.6, outweighs the cost we have spent. So, this method is certainly worth investing more on. \n\n| Method | Visit/Customer | Sold/Visit | Revenue/Sold | Revenue/Customer |\n| :---------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: |\n|Call    | 24.42 | 0.38 | 5.00 | 47.59| \n|Email   | 24.73 | 0.39 | 9.98 |97.12 | \n|Email + Call| 26.73 | 0.45 | 15.06 | 183.65| \n\n### **Revenue over time**\nif we look at the boxplot of the weeks, sales have occured in each method we can observe that an expectation of selling faster could be plausible in case of \"Email\" method. \n\n![image-13](image-13.png)\n\nwe can see that for \"Email\" number of sales decreases over time, while it increases for \"Email + Call\". since, average price of items that aresold in the later method is higher we might intuitively conclude that customers that bought items in this method might need more time to decide on buying (the deal is more expensive). \n\n![image-14](image-14.png)\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"54c45c08-5750-4354-b902-21e250d8d630"},{"source":"## Recommendation\nAssuming that the demographic population in each method was sampled randomly and size of each population wasnt selected equally since some methods require more time for the following weeks, I would recommend we can focus on the following steps:\n- Using key metrics to monitor whether there is a change in each methods effectiveness and efficiency.\n- To implement the campaign more profitable, we could rule out \"Call\" method and invest more on \"Call + Email\":\n  - we can do this in Texas and California before rolling out for every state. \n  - We can focus on customers with less history with the firm (less than 10 years)\n- Stay on \"Email\" method as we are since it is the most efficient sales_method. \n- Data Collection for in-depth analysis\n  - Improve data quality - Test on equal size of population in each cohort\n\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"266e7af5-b840-4479-b6d9-54ba6f1150d3"},{"source":"## âœ… When you have finished...\n-  Publish your Workspace using the option on the left\n-  Check the published version of your report:\n\t-  Can you see everything you want us to grade?\n    -  Are all the graphics visible?\n-  Review the grading rubric.
